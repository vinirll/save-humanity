# Solution

Problem: https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/save-humanity

The solution is made upon a well-known algorithm called: Z-Algorithm

I've also considered initially the following well-known Algorithms:
- Boyer-Moore
- KMP
- Ahoâ€“Corasick

But the Z-Algorithm has similar complexity and are very simple to build for only one mismatch

# Complexity

It is a linear time and space pattern search Algorithm: O(n + m)
- n being the length of the Text
- m being the length of the Pattern

This problem can be solved in polynomial time, so this problem is in class P

# Tests

## All local tests are written using Spek Framework
## All hackerrank tests are passing
